/**
 * The home screen's model list: pi's full catalogue, with a config-only
 * fallback.
 *
 * The session composer asks a live pi process over RPC (`get_available_models`),
 * which is authoritative — full display names, every built-in provider
 * (Bedrock, Anthropic, OpenAI…), not just what the user declared in
 * models.json. Nothing is running before the first prompt, so this spawns a
 * throwaway `pi --mode rpc --no-session` process (the exact machinery every
 * live session already uses via `PiRpcClient`), asks the one question, and
 * disposes it. Same call, same data, same names — home and session render
 * identically by construction instead of by two formatters staying in sync.
 *
 * Earlier versions of this parsed `pi --list-models`'s text table instead.
 * That table only ever prints `model.id` (verified against pi's own
 * `cli/list-models.js`, which builds its rows from `m.id` and never reads
 * `m.name`, even though every model it holds in memory has one) — not a
 * parsing gap, a missing column. No text-table plumbing can fix that; only
 * asking the same question the RPC does.
 *
 * `fromConfig` remains the fallback for when pi can't be run (missing, too
 * old, or the setup screen is showing), so the picker degrades to the user's
 * declared models rather than going empty.
 *
 * `resolveBinary`, `fromConfig`, and `listModels` are injected so this
 * composes without requiring a pi binary on PATH under test.
 *
 * The fallback reports itself. It used to swallow every failure into a bare
 * `catch {}` and return the models.json list as though it were the catalogue,
 * so a transient boot-time failure showed the user a one-model picker and told
 * them their configured default was "unavailable" — with no log line, and no
 * way for a caller to know the answer was degraded. `source` is what lets both
 * the log and the picker say which list this is.
