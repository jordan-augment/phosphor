/**
 * What slash commands pi resolves for a folder, without a session.
 *
 * A live session learns its own list over the `get_commands` RPC at bootstrap
 * (`src/stores/sessions.ts`), which is why the chat composer has a `/` menu and
 * the home composer had none: before the first prompt there is no pi process to
 * ask. This module asks the same question of a throwaway
 * `pi --mode rpc --no-session` — the probe the skills page and the model
 * catalogue already use, no tokens spent — so the home composer can offer the
 * same commands the session it is about to start will have.
 *
 * Bundled Phosphor extensions register no commands, so `--no-session` (no `-e`)
 * resolves the same list a real session would.
 *
 * One cache, two readers. `pi:commands` (the home composer) and the Skills
 * page both need this answer; each used to spawn its own pi for it. The cache
 * is keyed by folder — project prompts and `<ws>/.pi/skills` differ per
 * folder — and cleared by `invalidateCommandCaches` from every mutation that
 * changes the answer (`electron/ipc/pi-config-handlers.ts`).
