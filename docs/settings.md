# 09 — Settings

A **modal**, not a second window (`ModalOverlay` in
`src/features/settings/SettingsModal.tsx`), so it inherits the theme, the UI
scale and the app's lifecycle. Cmd/Ctrl+, opens it; Cmd/Ctrl+/ opens it on
Keybindings.

Nine top-level tabs and four indented under Extensions. MCP Connectors is always
present; the other three belong to a package and render **only while that
package is installed**. The package list is re-read on every open, so a fresh
install gets its tab without a restart, and a tab whose package vanished falls
back to Extensions.

| Tab              | What it is                                                                            | Writes                                                  |

Phosphor's prefs live in electron-store. pi's config stays in pi's files. The
two are never mixed.

## Appearance

- Theme: Light / Dark / System. Switches live across the app, Monaco, xterm,
  Shiki and Mermaid.
- **UI scale** zooms text, icons and spacing together (the same value
  Cmd/Ctrl+plus/minus/0 nudge). Separate chat, editor and terminal font sizes,
  each applied live.
- Mono font: JetBrains Mono is bundled; the other entries use whatever the OS
  has.
- All of it is Phosphor's own state. Nothing here touches pi.

## Agent

Writes pi's own `settings.json`. A **Scope** switch picks global
(`~/.pi/agent`) or the current workspace (`<ws>/.pi/settings.json`). Each scope
is read **unmerged**: the editor shows what that file actually contains, so a
project edit never bakes inherited global values into the project file. In
project scope, an empty field's placeholder names what it inherits.

- **Default model** and **default provider** are free text, not pickers: pi
  accepts any id its config knows, including a custom `models.json` or a local
  endpoint no catalogue would list.
- Default thinking level (off · minimal · low · medium · high · xhigh · max);
  `hideThinkingBlock`.
- Steering / follow-up delivery ("all" vs "one-at-a-time").
- Compaction (enabled, reserveTokens, keepRecentTokens) and retry (enabled,
  maxRetries, baseDelayMs). Compaction applies to every provider, including
  Claude Code; switching models does not override the user's choice.
- **Context budget**: a shared target for interactive sessions on every
  provider, Claude Code included (default 200k; 400k; model maximum; or
  custom, 100k–1M). Bare numbers are thousands: `500` means 500k, previewed
  beside the field. This unscoped Phosphor pref stays editable even when pi's
  settings file is broken. pi uses the capped window between tool cycles, including live
  sessions. Smaller windows retain pi's native limit. See
  [One context budget](cli-providers.md#one-context-budget).
- **Directives**: what Phosphor appends to every lane's system prompt, global
  or per project, shown composed before it is sent. A prompt you cannot read is
  one you cannot debug.
- If the target file is not valid JSON, editing is **disabled** rather than
  best-effort, and the banner routes to Advanced to repair it by hand. Main
  never overwrites a config it could not parse.
- pi settings apply to **new** sessions. The context budget is the live-session
  exception described above.

## Accounts

The subscription routes are distinct (`SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS` in
`electron/pi/auth-status.ts` is the registry):

| Account        | Route                                                                      | Requirement                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ChatGPT        | pi's native `openai-codex` OAuth; no Codex CLI bridge                      | Plus or Pro                   |
| Claude         | Authenticated Claude Code CLI through `@saccolabs/pi-claude-cli`           | Pro or Max; provider ≥ 0.10.0 |
| GitHub Copilot | pi account login on github.com; Enterprise Server uses pi's terminal login | Copilot subscription          |
| Kimi           | pi's `kimi-for-coding` account login                                       | Kimi For Coding plan          |

Provider limits and billing rules still apply. Native Anthropic OAuth is a
separate route from Claude Code subscription sessions, and the tab says it
bills extra usage. xAI, OpenRouter and Radius sign-ins draw on a credit
balance, not an included allowance.

- One row per provider pi can sign into, showing ready / not ready from
  `pi auth check --json`, and a Sign in button that drives pi's TUI off-screen.
- A signed-in row also shows **which account** when the credential is a JWT
  that names one (ChatGPT/Codex today). The email claim is read inside the
  main process; the credential itself is never stored, logged or sent to the
  renderer. Providers with an opaque credential show "Signed in" and nothing
  more.
- **Sign in again** (switching accounts) finishes when the credential
  _changes_, not when `pi auth check` first reports ready: the old credential
  already answers ready a second after pi prints the URL.

This tab is pi's own `auth`, nothing more. The **Claude Code** provider keeps
its own set of logins under Extensions → Claude Code.

## Extensions

pi package management: extensions, skills, prompts and themes. Reads come from
pi's settings files and install dirs; every mutation shells out to pi's own
package manager (`pi install` / `pi remove` / `pi update`) with the output
streamed into the tab, so a failure is legible rather than a silent no-op.

- A **Recommended** catalogue of curated packages, then Installed lists by
  scope (global, this workspace). Each row shows version, what it contributes
  (`2 extensions · 1 skill`), and a `vX available` chip when the registry says
  so. The registry lookup never blocks the local listing.
- Add a package by spec (`npm:pkg`, `git:github.com/user/repo`, or an absolute
  path), plus Update all. Packages run with full system access, and the tab
  says so.
- A declared-but-not-installed package is labelled "installs on next session
  start". pi installs at session start, never on its own.

Three packages contribute a nested tab, shown only while installed:

### Claude Code (`pi-claude-cli`)

Routes model calls through the Claude Code CLI, billing your Claude Pro/Max
plan; its models appear in the picker under the `pi-claude-cli` provider. In
order: **Health** (package present, CLI binary found, both versions, update
rows), **Accounts**, pi context ownership guidance (Claude sessions follow
the Agent tab's compaction settings and context budget), **Prove it end to end** (one tiny
print-mode prompt through the CLI, the login and the extension at once, because
"installed" and "working" are different claims), and **When it fails**. See
[cli-providers.md](cli-providers.md).

- **Accounts** keeps several Claude logins and routes one to each new session
  (`specific`, `ordered`, `round-robin`). An account is held back from new
  sessions while the provider reports it rejected, at its window, or
  **spending overage credits**. A running session keeps its account: the
  credential is fixed at spawn. The context popover names the account a lane
  is spending and shows that account's own plan usage.
- Each account row **opens** onto its usage windows and the live sessions
  spending it. A session there can be restarted on the same account or moved
  to another; both respawn it from its session file, which is the only way an
  account can change.

### Web access (`pi-web-access`)

Search, fetching and PDF extraction for sessions, written to the package's
`web-search.json`. Common search providers get first-class fields; the rest
stay reachable through the raw file.

### Computer use (`@injaneity/pi-computer-use`)

Read-only: what the package adds (observe windows, search UI elements, click,
type, scroll) and the accessibility permissions it needs.

### MCP Connectors

Nested under Extensions, since a connector is configuration for the MCP adapter
rather than a top-level app concern.

- **Connectors**: the curated OAuth catalog (Linear, Notion, Braintrust,
  Datadog, Supabase, Questrade, Fellow, Slack). Add, sign in, reconnect,
  remove. Add starts the sign-in itself. Signing in drives the adapter's own
  `/mcp-auth`; Phosphor holds no tokens and only writes `mcp-adapter.json` (or the
  project's `.mcp.json`).
- **MCP**: the `mcp-adapter.json` resolution chain, custom servers, raw JSON repair.
- Both are specified in [mcp.md](mcp.md).

## Workspaces

- **Naming and markers**: auto-naming on/off, the word range and character cap
  for generated titles, the branch-slug cap, the lane marker mode, and whether
  lanes show their PR status (`LanePrefs`). Every number is clamped in both
  the renderer and main, and the branch-length row previews a real slug. See
  [lanes.md](lanes.md#preferences).
- **New sessions**: whether a chat gets its own branch and worktree, and the
  branch prefix (`WorktreePrefs`). Same switch as the "worktree" checkbox in
  the branch menu.
- **Workspaces**: the recent list, one row per folder, offering exactly two
  things: **Reset layout** (drops every localStorage key for that path, so a
  wedged split is recoverable) and **Remove**, which forgets the folder and
  touches nothing on disk. Reordering lives in the sidebar, on each workspace
  group's kebab, where you can see the order you are changing.
- **Sandboxes**: the scratch folders behind "No folder", listed apart from
  recents. Each is minted under a random `adjective-noun` name and shows its
  item count and last use. **Rename** changes the folder on disk and moves its
  chats with it — a sandbox IS its path, so the rename re-points recents, the
  launch-resume pair, and every pin, marker and unseen badge on its sessions.
  "Its chats" means the whole subtree: a sandbox that is a git repo has lanes,
  each its own cwd with its own pair of transcript directories, and moving only
  the root's pair orphaned every lane chat. Running chats in the sandbox are
  **closed** as part of the rename, and the prompt says how many before you
  commit. They have to be — pi cannot keep working in a folder that has moved,
  and since nothing reclaims an idle session's process, refusing instead meant
  a sandbox you had actually used could not be renamed for the rest of the
  launch. Deleting moves the folder _and its chats_ to the Trash, and is still
  refused while anything is running anywhere inside it. An empty sandbox is
  reused.
  A rename also **rewrites the cwd stored inside each session file**, because
  pi refuses to resume a session whose stored cwd is gone — it prints
  `Stored session working directory does not exist` and exits 1 before the RPC
  loop starts, which reads as a chat that simply will not open. Correcting the
  cwd on the scan is not enough: that fixes what Phosphor passes pi, not what
  pi reads back out of the file. See
  [ui-shell.md](ui-shell.md#left-sidebar-claude-desktop-style).

## Optimization

Headroom, the local tool-result compression proxy. Opening the tab probes
`/health` and looks for the binary but never starts the proxy and never
installs anything. Every action is a button.

- **Status + lifecycle**: installed or not, version, whether the proxy runs and
  on which loopback port, and whether Phosphor owns it or _adopted_ one already
  running (Stop is only offered for a proxy we own). Install runs `uv` with
  streamed output and names the manual command.
- **Compress tool results**: large JSON tool results are restructured
  losslessly before entering context, or left alone. Never summarized. Applies
  to new sessions. Compressing plain search/log output is deliberately off:
  that direction is only reversible through Headroom's retrieval store, which
  needs a Phosphor retrieve tool first.
- **Savings** for the current workspace: tokens saved, lanes with savings, a
  per-lane bar chart read from the session files.
- **Advisor**: findings computed from your session files and configuration.
  Never a model call, never an action taken for you. Each row is tip / warning
  / serious and jumps to the tab that fixes it.

## Advanced

- **Agent**: which coding agent new sessions run on — **pi** (the default) or
  **omp** (oh-my-pi, a pi fork) — plus an optional explicit binary path per
  agent. Stored in Phosphor prefs (`AppPrefs.agent`, normalized on read: an
  unknown agent reads as pi, paths are trimmed). An explicit path wins
  outright and is reported as broken if it does not run — never swapped for a
  PATH lookup; empty means the login shell's PATH, then the process PATH.
  Changing either stores the choice (`app:setAgent`), drops every
  agent-derived cache in main (health, `/` commands, model catalogue, session
  folder watchers) and reloads the window. Running sessions keep the process
  they spawned. Health, the `/` menu, the model catalogue, spawns and the
  sidebar's session folders all follow the choice; pi's own CLI surfaces
  (sign-in, `pi auth`, packages, MCP connectors, this tab's raw editors and
  resource list) stay on pi. How omp is spoken to:
  [pi-integration.md](pi-integration.md#omp-oh-my-pi).
- **Agent health**: the selected agent's resolved binary, version, and — for
  pi only — the minimum version Phosphor supports. omp numbers its own
  releases, so `MIN_PI_VERSION` is never applied to it. When the selected agent
  is unavailable the setup screen blocks the app; under omp it offers **Use pi
  instead**, since Settings is behind it.
- **Raw file editors** (Monaco JSON) for `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and
  `models.json`, with a "restart sessions to apply" note. The escape hatch the
  Agent tab points at when a file is too broken to edit structurally.
- **Maintenance**: a periodic sweep for worktrees whose branch already landed.
  It always _measures_ ("N of M worktrees reclaimable") and only deletes once
  "Delete automatically" is on. Interval (≥15 min) and a grace period (a merged
  lane is kept this long after its last use) are configurable. See
  [lanes.md](lanes.md#reclaiming-lanes-automatically).
- **Local pi resources**: a read-only listing of the loose extensions, prompts
  and themes pi discovered. Packages are the Extensions tab; skills have their
  own page ([ui-shell.md](ui-shell.md#global-surfaces)). `auth.json` is never
  read or displayed.

## Keybindings

A static sheet of every shortcut in four groups: **App**, **Chat**,
**Formatting**, **Editor & terminal**. Not remappable yet. Spellings follow
Claude Code and Claude Desktop where a binding exists there (Esc Esc rewind, ↑
prompt history, ⌃O verbose output), so muscle memory carries over. Terminal
copy/paste differs per platform because Ctrl+C must stay SIGINT off macOS.

## About

App version, an on-demand **Check now** for updates (the sidebar pill only
appears once there is something to act on, so this is the way to ask "am I
current?"), the selected agent's version and path, platform/arch, Electron and
Node versions, and the bundled font licenses. A pi newer than the line
Phosphor is verified against gets a warning: newer minors usually work, but
protocol additions may not be surfaced yet. omp gets no such warning.
