 * left the user with no way to tell whether that was their case. The installed
 * version has to come from the main process; the chat store knows pi's
 * protocol, not its build. Health is TTL-cached there, so this is cheap.
 *
 * Upgrading is not the whole instruction either: the session is already bound
 * to a subprocess of the old pi, which lives until the session is restarted.
 *
 * `rejection` is pi's own error, or null when pi answered success with no
 * queues. Only a rejection proves the queues were left alone, so only then
